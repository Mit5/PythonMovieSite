# PythonMovieSite
A small web project I made to teach myself to use Flask and SQLAlchemy.

The website allows users to view movies and make lists containing movies and reviews if they are logged in.
Users can also see the reviews and lists of other users.

The project keeps the user data in a local database.

The users can be a normal user and an admin.
The normal user can view movies and make reviews, containing a description and a number score. In addition to this, the normal user can also create lists with movies and copy those of other users. Upon registration 3 lists are created for each user: Favourites, Watched and To Watch.
The admin can delete and promote other users to admin. The admin can also add, edit and delete movies from the database.
